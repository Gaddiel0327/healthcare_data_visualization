# Healthcare Data Analysis/ Visulization Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze healthcare data to gain insights into various aspects of patient care, outcomes, and cost factors. The dataset used for analysis contains information such as patient demographics, medical conditions, treatments, billing amounts, and more. By exploring this dataset, we seek to answer several key research questions related to healthcare delivery and patient outcomes.

## Methodology
The analysis will involve exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to understand the distribution and relationships between various variables in the dataset. Statistical analysis and data visualization will be used to identify patterns and trends related to the research questions. Additionally, an interactive dashboard will be developed using HTML, JavaScript, and MongoDB to visualize the analysis results and provide users with an intuitive interface for exploring the data.



## Getting Started
To run the analysis and view the interactive dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python dependencies.
3. Set up MongoDB and import the dataset into a MongoDB database.
4. Open the HTML and JavaScript files for the interactive dashboard.
5. Configure the dashboard to connect to your MongoDB database and retrieve the data.
6. Launch the dashboard in a web browser to interactively explore the analysis results.
